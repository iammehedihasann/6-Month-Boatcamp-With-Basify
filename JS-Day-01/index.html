                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented programming language used by developers to make web
                pages interactive. It allows developers to create dynamically updating content, use animations, pop-up
                menus, clickable buttons, control multimedia, etc.

            <p>
                One of the reasons behind JavaScript's popularity and widespread adoption is its versatility. It
                supports cross-platform development, and we can use it for both server-side and client-side
                applications. JS also has a massive active community of developers, making it easy for beginners to
                learn the language.
