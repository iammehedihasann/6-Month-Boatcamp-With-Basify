                         Introduction to Responsive Design:<br>
                        <ol class="media"><span>Queries:</span>  Media queries allow the application of different styles depending on the screen size or device characteristics. They are essential for creating layouts that adapt to various devices like phones, tablets, and desktops</ol> <br>
                        <ol class="view"><span>Viewport Units (vh, vw):</span> Viewport height (vh) and viewport width (vw) are CSS units that represent a percentage of the viewport's height or width. These units are useful for creating responsive layouts that scale with the user's screen.</ol><br>
                        <ol class="mobile"><span> Mobile-first approach:</span> The mobile-first approach involves designing for smaller screens first, then progressively adding styles for larger screens. This ensures that the core experience is optimized for mobile users while still working on larger devices.</ol><br>
